## Create a humorous tweet for this project publish. Hilight I used `Dobby 70B model` and what you can get from using this project.

⏺ Here are some humorous tweet options for your AI Daily Digest project:

Option 1 (Self-deprecating dev humor):
🤖 Built an AI Daily Digest bot that fetches Reddit's hottest AI takes, processes them
with Dobby 70B (yes, the house elf got an upgrade), and serves you curated AI news
daily.

Because manually scrolling r/LocalLLaMA at 3am wasn't sustainable.

🧵 Get your daily dose of "AGI by Tuesday" predictions: [link]

Option 2 (Community-focused):
📰 Tired of missing the latest "Claude vs GPT" drama on Reddit?

My AI Daily Digest bot powered by Dobby 70B now serves you:
✅ Top AI posts from 8 subreddits
✅ Smart summaries & categories
✅ Zero doom-scrolling required

Finally, AI news without the rabbit holes! 🐰🕳️

Option 3 (Technical but fun):
🔥 Just shipped: AI Daily Digest bot

- Scrapes Reddit's AI chaos
- Dobby 70B makes sense of it all
- Delivers to your Telegram daily

What you get: Curated AI insights
What you avoid: 47 tabs of "Is this AGI?" posts

The house elf works so you don't have to! 🧙‍♂️

Option 4 (Meme-heavy):
Me: _builds bot to avoid manually checking 8 AI subreddits_

Bot: _uses Dobby 70B to summarize posts_

Also me: "This is definitely not over-engineering"

Features: Daily digests, chat support, and my questionable life choices ✨

Pick the one that matches your Twitter vibe! The Dobby reference works great since
it's both technical and playful.
